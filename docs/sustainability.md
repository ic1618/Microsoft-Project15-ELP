# Sustainability Report

Sustainability [means meeting our own needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs](http://www.mcgill.ca/sustainability/files/sustainability/what-is-sustainability.pdf). It can be categorised into three sections.

## Social

[Poaching can be defined as illegally killing wildlife or any animal for food, pleasure, ivory, fur or more. One main reason that people poach animals is for rare products, such as ivory and fur.](https://www.4elephants.org/blog/article/why-elephants-are-poached)

Currently, there is an international ban on ivory trade, however poaching still occurs. The poaching of elephants is for their ivory tusks which are used for ornaments, piano keys and other items used by humans. The poachers are not usually the ones who keep the ivory, they sell them and it is part of their day to day income. 

Although it is part of their income and to support their day to day life, the ivory trade is still illegal, and elephant poaching as a whole is illegal in national parks (some people poach elephants for their skin and meat).

The Nouabale-Ndoki national park is where our client is currently based, and trying to prevent poaching. This national park has the [following goals:](https://congo.wcs.org/Wild-Places/Nouabale-Ndoki-National-Park.aspx) 

- Strengthening protected area management capacity

- Protecting the park and its wildlife through the implementation of a full-chain, hunter to consumer, wildlife law enforcement program

- Working with remote, local communities to improve their livelihoods, promote sustainable natural resource use in the park periphery, and work towards a situation where people feel that they benefit from the park
-
- Using science to drive informed conservation decisions for the long-term protection of the Ndoki landscape and its wildlife.

Our gunshot detection system can help to achieve these sustainability goals.
