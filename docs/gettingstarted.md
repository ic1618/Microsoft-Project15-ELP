Firstly install Anaconda by following the guide [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

### Creating an Anaconda virtual environment

It is necessary to create a virtual environment when running a project in order to keep all your dependencies (in our case python library versions) isolated from other versions of the packages you may have.

Launch the Anaconda Prompt once you have Anaconda installed.
