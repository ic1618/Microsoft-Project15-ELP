# Ethical consequences

## Responsible AI - Microsoft Values

In developing our AI/Machine Learning system, we took into account the ethical values that Microsoft teaches it's employees, clients and other companies. The 6 pillars Microsoft teach to build AI systems responsibly are:
- Fairness -  AI systems should treat all people fairly 
- Reliability & Safety - AI systems should perform reliably and safely
- Privacy & Security - AI systems should be secure and respect privacy
- Inclusiveness - AI systems should empower everyone and engage people
- Transparency - AI systems should be understandable
- Accountability - People should be accountable for AI systems

### Fairness

Making sure that the systems developed and deployed reduce unfairness in society, rather than keeping it at the same level or making it worse! The way we tackled this pillar was to talk to as many people from different industries as possible in developing our system! We talked to Computer Vision experts, Cloud Advocates, University Proffessors and very importantly our client who works in the field!

### Reliability & Safety

In order to develop a system that is reliable, we asked our client for a various amount of test data in which we tested on our system. This meant that we can provide statistics and behaviours of our system in different situations to inform out client on it's performance, but also events they should look out for for the system to perform as it should.

### Privacy & Security

We made sure to ask our client what we were allowed and not allowed to publicly make available, such as the dataset we were using, images of the locations of acoustic recorders currently deployed, meeting recordings and private discussions we had about the project. This meant that we could build our system in a secure way, which does not endanger anyone on the project or the forest elephants we are trying to protect.

### Inclusiveness

### Transparency

### Accountability
