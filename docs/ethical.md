# Ethical consequences

## Responsible AI - Microsoft Values

In developing our AI/Machine Learning system, we took into account the ethical values that Microsoft teaches it's employees, clients and other companies. The 6 pillars Microsoft teach to build AI systems responsibly are:
- Fairness -  AI systems should treat all people fairly 
- Reliability & Safety - AI systems should perform reliably and safely
- Privacy & Security - AI systems should be secure and respect privacy
- Inclusiveness - AI systems should empower everyone and engage people
- Transparency - AI systems should be understandable
- Accountability - People should be accountable for AI systems

### Fairness

Making sure that the systems devleoped and deployed reduce unfairness in society, rather than keeping it at the same level or making it worse! 

### Reliability & Safety
