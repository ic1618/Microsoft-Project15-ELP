## Concept

The concept of our system was to train a machine learning model in order to classify sound. The sound classification would be to detect whether or not there was a gunshot. Initially we began research by reading papers and watching video lectures in signal processing. All sources of research we used can be found in ["Code and resources used"](coderesources.md).
